# SQLAPI
This is a basic REST API with CRUD actions that is integrated with a Microsoft SQL Server Database.
It uses Dapper to perform parameterized SQL queries. 

NOTE: The Project solution name is "BookShopAPI" because of what I plan on using the API for in a future Project.
There are barely any comments as of now as it is really rudimentary and more of a test to showcase my rudimentary API and SQL skillset.
